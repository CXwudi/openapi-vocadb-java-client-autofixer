# VocaDB OpenAPI Java Client Autofixer

Autofix for VocaDB API Java Client generated by OpenAPI

## How to use

### 0. I don't want to generate my own client, I want your already-generated-and-fixed client

Just go to my sample [VocaDB OpenAPI Java Client](https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-openapi-client-java), and no need to read the rest of this doc üòÅ

### 1. Generate your raw VocaDB API client

1. install OpenAPI (see [instruction](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#1---installation))
   - optionally you can use docker to run OpenAPI generator, see [instruction](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#16---docker)
2. grab the `swagger.json` from VocaDB API [page](https://vocadb.net/swagger/index.html)
3. open bash and run these command

   ``` shell
openapi-generator-cli generate \
   --api-package <your package>.api \
   --model-package <your package>.model \
   --invoker-package <your package>.client \
   -i <location of the vocadb swagger.json file> \
   --group-id <your group-id> \
   --artifact-id <your artifact-id> \
   --artifact-version <your version> \
   -g java  \
      -p java8=true \
      -p dateLibrary=java8-localdatetime \
      -p useRuntimeException=true \
      -p useJakartaEe=true \
      -p openApiNullable=false \
      -p serializationLibrary=jackson \
      -p licenseName=<your license name> \
      -p licenseUrl=<your license url> \
   --library <any candidates other than okhttp-gson> \
   -o /local/sample-unfixed-client
   ```
   - available library candidates are specified in OpenAPI Java [page](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/generators/java.md)
   - if you are using docker, make sure you modified the generator launch command,
     properly mounted the output directory,
     and modify the `-o` option to fit docker's environment

4. (if using `resttemplate` or `webclient`) resolve import conflict in `UserApiApi.java`
   1. remove `import <your package>.model.MediaType;`
   2. let `apiUsersCurrentAlbumsAlbumIdPost()` and `apiUsersCurrentAlbumsAlbumIdPostWithHttpInfo()` take the parameter of type `<your package>.model.MediaType`
5. (Optional) update some dependencies used by the client
   1. spring and Jackson related dependencies
   2. remove `jackson-databind-nullable`
   3. copy LICENSE, etc.

### 2. Fix your raw client with this auto fixer

1. clone this project `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-openapi-java-client-autofixer`
2. open the [my-config.yml](./vocadb-apiclient-fixer/my-config.yml) file in [`./vocadb-apiclient-fixer`](vocadb-apiclient-fixer/) and edit it
   1. input directory is where your auto-generated client is
      - can be relative path from the [`./vocadb-apiclient-fixer`](vocadb-apiclient-fixer/) perspective
   2. relative path to model is the relative path from the input directory to path of `--model-package` on your `openapi-generator-cli` command
3. cd into [`./vocadb-apiclient-fixer`](vocadb-apiclient-fixer/), run `./mvnw spring-boot:run '-Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--spring.config.import=file:my-config.yml"'`
4. your client should be ready to use üòâ

## Notes

### Before generate

- OpenAPI is very fragile, so better stick with the command in the step to generate your client
- Gson is not working for parsing date, like `Expected BEGIN_OBJECT but was STRING at line 1 column 109 path $.items[0].song.createDate`
- when using Jackson, must put `-p openApiNullable=false`, otherwise parsing issue on list with `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot deserialize instance of 'org.openapitools.jackson.nullable.JsonNullable<java.util.List<cx.mikufan.vocadbapiclient.model.SongInListForApiContract>>' out of START_ARRAY token`. This is because with `openApiNullable=true`, your list is `JsonNullable<List<>>` instead of `List<>`
- as for data library, use `java8-localdatetime`
  - the default one `threetenbp` has parsing issue
  - the `java-8` one use `ZoneDateTime` which requires an additional zone info in the string, but vocadb's date doesn't have it
- the [my-config.yml](./vocadb-apiclient-fixer/my-config.yml) file has some default config values filled in. It is used to autofix the [sample-unfixed-client](./sample-unfixed-client) for demo purposes.
  - In fact, the sample [VocaDB OpenAPI Java Client](https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-openapi-client-java) is fixed by this demo config

### When using the client

see [notes](https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-openapi-client-java#notes) in my sample client

## So what does this auto fixer trying to fix

This fixer will change all enum classes with suffixname of `s` into a class that can make Jackson JSON parser works for one-line multiple-value enum string.  
For example, take a look at the `SongForApiContract` in the sample-unfixed-client.
It has a field `private PVServices pvServices;`.
Before fixing, `PVServices` is just an enum class. It can only accept one value for that field.  
However, in reality, VocaDB could return multiple values for that field, separated by comma (like `pvServers: "NicoNicoDouga, Youtube"`).  
So the fixer will change each enum class like `PVServices` into a normal class that can accept such multiple values of the same enum.  
And each new class will have customized `@JsonCreator` and `@JsonValue` annotations to stay compatible with the behavior of the old unfixed enum class.

This fixer also globally replaces all strings `ApiApi` to `Api`.
If a file name contains such a string, the file is also renamed.
