# Auto-generated VocaDB OpenAPI Java Client

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/CXwudi/vocadb-openapi-client-java.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#CXwudi/vocadb-openapi-client-java)

A sample VocaDB API Java Client that is auto-generated by [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) and is auto-fixed by my [VocaDB OpenAPI Java Client Autofixer](https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-openapi-java-client-autofixer)

The original README file coming from this auto-generated client is in [README Original.md](./README%20Original.md)

This client is generated by:

``` shell
openapi-generator-cli generate \
  --api-package mikufan.cx.vocadbapiclient.api \
  --model-package mikufan.cx.vocadbapiclient.model \
  --invoker-package mikufan.cx.vocadbapiclient.client \
  -i https://vocadb.net/swagger/v1/swagger.json \
  --group-id mikufan.cx \
  --artifact-id vocadb-api-client \

## How to use

Please read VocaDB API Usage [Rules](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/wiki/Public-API#api-usage-rules) before using this API client.

Refer to the [generated documentation](./README%20Original.md#documentation-for-api-endpoints) for how to use this client

## Notes

- Highly recommended to set your custom User-Agent in `ApiClient` for VocaDB to [identity you](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/wiki/Public-API#api-usage-rules)
- This client probably won't work well for any non-GET requests. Base on VocaDB [document](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/wiki/Public-API#authenticated-apis), you need to set some custom header to be able to use it. This probably can be done by tunning the `RestTemplate` instance inside `ApiClient`
- Take a look of your client, understand the structure
  - api directory is where you use to call the VocaDB Rest API
  - `ApiClient` is the core class
- By default, the base URL is always `http://localhost`, change it to `https://vocadb.net` by calling `setBaseurl()` on `ApiClient` class
  - for Java 11 native HTTP client, use `setHostname("vocadb.net")` and `setScheme("https")` (Java 11 native HTTP client doesn't have `setBaseurl()`). If you don't do `setScheme("https")`, you need to manually add `builder.followRedirects(Redirect.NORMAL)`
- Because VocaDB and UtaiteDB use the same codebase, you could probably change the base URL to `https://utaitedb.net` to make your client an UtaiteDB Api Client.
  - be aware that some artist types are a bit different between VocaDB and UtaiteDB, as ycanardeau [said](https://discord.com/channels/309072240639737866/723937904216375317/844444328662401044)
  - if having problems on UtaiteDB, you can always grab the `swagger.json` file from UtaiteDB API [page](https://utaitedb.net/swagger/index.html) and regernate your client just for UtaiteDB
- Test cases are all `@Ignored` when generated by OpenAPI. To run some of them, explicitly remove the `@Ignored` and run it at your own [risk](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/wiki/Public-API#api-usage-rules) (e.g. IP banned by VocaDB)
